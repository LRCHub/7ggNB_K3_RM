The spawn of Satan's back
It's made of steel and black
It comes to bring you pain
It comes again and again
Road train
The spawn of Satan's here
It's come to bring you fear
It sets the road aflame
It comes to kill and maim
Road train
Lights that shine like bulging eyes
Keep on trucking through the night
The vortex opens through
Drive right in and straight through you
The spawn of Satan comes
It's carting oil drums
It's racing down the lane
With oily fiery rain
Road train
Twenty-six gears of petrol power
Keep on trucking hour by hour
One man is at the wheel
He's the dog at Satan's heel
Across the desert to the trees
Obliteration of the place
From the fire into the sea
Nonagon infinity
Is coming
The spawn of Satan speeds
The road beneath it bleeds
It comes to bring you shame
It comes again and again
Road train
Burning wheels of fiery red
Keep on trucking 'til we're dead
The beast is angry too
Drive real fast and eat up you
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Is coming
