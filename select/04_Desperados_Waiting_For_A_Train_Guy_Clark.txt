I played the Red River Valley
He'd sit in the kitchen and cry
Run his fingers through
Seventy years of livin'
And wonder: "Lord, why has every well I've drilled gone dry?"

We were friends,
Me and this old man
We's like desperados
Waitin' for a train
Desperados
Waitin' for a train

He's a drifter,
A driller of oil wells
He's an old school man
Of the world
He taught me how to drive his car when he was too drunk to
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives was like
Some old Western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk
He'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There was old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they played
I was just a kid
They all called me "Sidekick"
Just like desperados
Waitin' for a train
Like desperados
Waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and
He's pushin' eighty
He's got brown tobacco stains
All down his chin
Well to me he was a hero of
This country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men?
Drinkin' beer and playin'
Moon and Forty-two
Jus' like desperados
Waitin' for a train
Like a desperado
Waitin' for a train

The day 'fore he died
I went to see him
I was grown and he was
Almost gone.
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang one more verse to
That old song

"Come on, Jack"
"That son-of-a-bitch is comin'"

We're desperados
Waitin' for a train
Was like desperados
Waitin' for a train
